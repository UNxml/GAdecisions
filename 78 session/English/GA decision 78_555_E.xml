                <p xml:space="preserve"> 	In order to accommodate all speakers at the Summit, statements by the participating States should be limited to five minutes, pursuant to paragraph 7 of resolution <a href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/76/307">76/307</a>, on the understanding that this will not preclude the distribution of more extensive texts. Pursuant to rule 72 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, when a representative exceeds her or his allotted time, the President shall call the speaker to order without delay, which will be done by means of automatic microphone cut-off. In order to ensure that the statements from the list of speakers will begin on time at 10 a.m. at the morning meeting of 22 September 2024, any explanation of vote on the outcome document shall be incorporated into national statements instead of being made at the opening segment.</p>
